# VIF values for the fixed effects in an ordinal mixed-effects model
# Load necessary packages

# Assuming 'data' has an ordinal response 'y', fixed effects 'x1', 
# and a grouping variable 'group' for the mixed effects
  
# 1. Fit the ordinal mixed-effects model

# 2. Extract the design matrix for only the fixed effects
# This approach calculates VIF for the fixed effects structure, independent of the mixed model aspects.
fixed_effects_data <- model.matrix(~ Area, data = scores_long)
  
# 3. Fit a linear model using just the fixed effects' design matrix
# The VIF calculation itself is based purely on the correlation among predictors.
vif_model <- lm(1 ~ fixed_effects_data - 1 # '-1' removes the intercept, as VIFs are for predictors

# 4. Calculate the VIF values using the car package's vif() function
vif_values <- vif(vif_model)
                
# Print the results
print(vif_values)
